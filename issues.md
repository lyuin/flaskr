# Flask Application Issues

## Priority 1: Critical Security Issues

### Issue 1: Hardcoded credentials in app configuration ✅
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: The application has hardcoded credentials (SECRET_KEY, USERNAME, PASSWORD) in the source code, which is a security risk.  
**Solution**: Move sensitive configuration to environment variables or a separate configuration file that is not committed to version control.  
**Status**: Implemented. Created a config.py module with different configuration classes for development, testing, and production environments. Sensitive information is now loaded from environment variables with fallbacks for development.

### Issue 2: Plain text password storage and comparison ⚠️
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: Passwords are stored and compared in plain text, which is a significant security vulnerability.  
**Solution**: Implement password hashing using a library like Werkzeug's security functions and update the login mechanism to use secure password verification.  
**Status**: Partially implemented. Added Werkzeug security imports, but still using plain text comparison for backward compatibility. This should be fully implemented in a future update.

### Issue 3: SQL injection vulnerabilities ✅
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: Some database operations may be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks if user input is not properly sanitized.  
**Solution**: Ensure all database queries use parameterized queries consistently.  
**Status**: Implemented. All database queries now use parameterized queries with proper parameter binding.

### Issue 4: No CSRF protection for forms ⚠️
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: The application does not implement CSRF protection for form submissions, making it vulnerable to cross-site request forgery attacks.  
**Solution**: Add Flask-WTF to implement CSRF protection and update forms in templates to include CSRF tokens.  
**Status**: Not yet implemented. This should be addressed in a future update.

## Priority 2: Code Structure and Organization

### Issue 5: Monolithic application structure ✅
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: The application has a monolithic structure without using the application factory pattern, making it difficult to test and maintain.  
**Solution**: Refactor the application to use the application factory pattern and organize routes into blueprints.  
**Status**: Implemented. The application now uses the application factory pattern in __init__.py and routes are organized in a blueprint in flaskr.py.

### Issue 6: Limited separation of concerns ✅
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: The application mixes concerns like database operations, route handling, and business logic in the same file.  
**Solution**: Separate concerns by creating modules for database operations, authentication, and other functionalities.  
**Status**: Implemented. Created a separate db.py module for database operations and organized routes in a blueprint.

### Issue 7: Inefficient database connection handling ✅
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: The database connection handling could be improved for better performance and reliability.  
**Solution**: Implement a more robust database connection mechanism with proper error handling.  
**Status**: Implemented. The database connection handling has been improved in the db.py module with proper error handling.

### Issue 8: No error handling for database operations ✅
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: The application lacks proper error handling for database operations, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.  
**Solution**: Add try-except blocks for database operations and implement proper error handling.  
**Status**: Implemented. Added try-except blocks for database operations with proper error messages.

## Priority 3: UI/UX and Minor Issues

### Issue 9: Typo in layout.html
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: There is a typo in layout.html ("Pyton" instead of "Python").  
**Solution**: Correct the typo in the template.

### Issue 10: No form validation
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: The application does not implement form validation, which could lead to invalid data being submitted.  
**Solution**: Add form validation using Flask-WTF or client-side validation.

### Issue 11: Duplicate AuthActions class
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: The AuthActions class is duplicated in both test_flaskr.py and conftest.py.  
**Solution**: Remove the duplicate class and use the one in conftest.py.

### Issue 12: Limited test coverage
**Label**: Q Developer  
**Description**: The test coverage could be improved to ensure all functionality is properly tested.  
**Solution**: Add more test cases to cover all routes and edge cases.
